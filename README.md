# Learn Go with Cyber Mountain Man 🏔️💻

A beginner-friendly Go (Golang) tutorial series inspired by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ) — restructured, extended, and explained in my own words.

This project is designed as a hands-on learning journey to help newcomers grasp core Go concepts with simple, annotated examples and exercises. Whether you're coming from Python, C++, or just getting into programming — this is your launchpad into Go.
