ðŸ§  LESSON 22 - CONTROLLERS: LOGIC STRUCTURE WITH METHODS

âœ… What You Learn:
- How to build a controller using Go structs and method receivers
- How to bind methods to routes for organized, scalable logic
- How to use dynamic parameters and validate them (e.g., userID)
- How to cleanly separate concerns: routing, logic, response

âœ… Why This Matters:
- Enables dependency injection (DBs, services, loggers) in the future
- Follows scalable architecture seen in large backend services
- Keeps code testable, modular, and idiomatic to Go

This controller pattern makes it easy to extend your app with new features
(e.g., POST /users, PUT /users/{id}), while remaining clean and organized.
