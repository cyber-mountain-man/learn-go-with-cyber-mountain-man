ðŸ§  LESSON 21 - ROUTING: CUSTOM 404 FALLBACK HANDLER

âœ… What You Learn:
- How to create a universal fallback for routes not matched by your router
- How to manually set the HTTP response status to 404
- How to serve a friendly and branded "Page Not Found" message

âœ… Why This Matters:
- A custom fallback improves user experience compared to default server 404s
- Ensures unknown paths don't accidentally leak server internals
- Gives you full control over error responses â€” critical for APIs and production services
- Aligns with best practices for clean, complete, user-friendly server behavior

Setting up a good fallback handler is a small but essential step toward building reliable, polished web applications.
