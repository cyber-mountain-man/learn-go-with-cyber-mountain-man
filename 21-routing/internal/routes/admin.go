/*
üß† LESSON 21 - ROUTING: ADMIN ROUTES

‚úÖ What You Learn:
- How to group related paths (e.g., /admin/*) under a single function
- How to define clean RESTful route mappings with chi
- How to return basic HTML/text responses via handlers
- How chi's router chaining simplifies modular route registration

‚úÖ Why This Matters:
- Grouping by domain (like "admin") prevents clutter in main.go
- Prepares you to extend /admin with more subroutes later (e.g., /admin/settings)
- Mirrors scalable API patterns used in real production systems
- Keeps route wiring highly readable and maintainable

This small file pattern becomes incredibly powerful once you add authentication, admin-only permissions, 
or grow your server with additional services.
