		// -----------------------------
		// We're using a hardcoded secret value here for demonstration.

		// The request passes validation, so call the next handler.

üß† LESSON 23 - AUTHENTICATION MIDDLEWARE (SIMULATED)

‚úÖ What This Teaches:
- Middleware in Go acts as a **filter** between the client and your route logic.
- `RequireAuth` demonstrates how to block or allow access **before** hitting route handlers.
- You learn how to:
  - Read request headers using `r.Header.Get(...)`
  - Return early with `http.Error()` and status codes like 401 Unauthorized
  - Compose middleware cleanly using `next.ServeHTTP(w, r)`

üîê Why This Pattern Matters:
- This is the **first line of defense** in any secure backend application.
- It supports scalable, layered security: you can apply this only to sensitive endpoints like `/admin` or `/private`.
- Easy to plug in real authentication systems later (e.g., JWT, OAuth2, session cookies).

üõ†Ô∏è Common Real-World Extensions:
- Check API keys or JWT tokens from headers
- Validate session IDs against a database
- Enforce HTTPS-only access
- Add rate-limiting or IP restrictions

üìå Best Practices:
- Don‚Äôt bloat route logic with access checks ‚Äî keep them in middleware
- Make middleware composable and testable on its own
- Return **clear, consistent error messages** for debugging and API users

This is your gateway to building **zero-trust, security-first Go web services**.
It's small in code, but massive in real-world impact.
