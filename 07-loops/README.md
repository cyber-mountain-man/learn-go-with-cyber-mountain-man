# 07 - Loops in Go

Loops are essential for repeating actions and processing data in Go. This lesson explores all key loop patterns using the `for` keyword, which is the **only looping construct in Go** — but powerful enough to cover `for`, `while`, and even `do-while` styles from other languages.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Use counting, conditional, and infinite `for` loops
- Control loop flow using `break` and `continue`
- Loop over slices and maps with `range`
- Filter and search using conditionals inside loops
- Modify slice contents using index-based loops
- Use nested loops
- Benchmark performance of loops using `time`

## 🔁 Loop Styles

### 🔹 Basic for loop

```go
for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

### 🔹 While-style loop

```go
counter := 0
for counter < 3 {
    counter++
}
```

### 🔹 Infinite loop with break

```go
for {
    if done {
        break
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Loop with continue

```go
for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
    if i%2 == 0 {
        continue
    }
    fmt.Println("Odd:", i)
}
```

---

## 🔂 Looping Over Data

### 🔸 Slice with index

```go
fruits := []string{"apple", "banana"}
for i, fruit := range fruits {
    fmt.Println(i, fruit)
}
```

### 🔸 Slice without index

```go
for _, fruit := range fruits {
    fmt.Println(fruit)
}
```

### 🔸 Map with range

```go
scores := map[string]int{"mario": 90}
for name, score := range scores {
    fmt.Println(name, score)
}
```

---

## 🔍 Filtering and Searching

### 🔸 Filter values during iteration

```go
for _, n := range nums {
    if n > 4 {
        fmt.Println("High value:", n)
    }
}
```

### 🔸 Early return inside function

```go
func findFruit(fruits []string, target string) {
    for _, fruit := range fruits {
        if fruit == target {
            fmt.Println("Found:", target)
            return
        }
    }
    fmt.Println("Not found")
}
```

---

## 🛠️ Index-Based Modification

```go
nums := []int{1, 2, 3}
for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
    nums[i] *= 2
}
```

---

## 🧱 Nested Loops

```go
for i := 1; i <= 2; i++ {
    for j := 1; j <= 3; j++ {
        fmt.Println(i, j)
    }
}
```

---

## ⏱️ Benchmarking a Loop (Advanced)

```go
start := time.Now()
sum := 0
for i := 0; i < 1_000_000; i++ {
    sum += i
}
fmt.Println("Elapsed:", time.Since(start))
```

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

| Concept | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| `for` | Replaces both `for` and `while` loops |
| `range` | Easy, idiomatic way to loop over slices and maps |
| `break` / `continue` | Clean control of loop flow |
| Early `return` | Exit functions efficiently when data is found |
| Index-based modification | Great for updating slice contents |
| Benchmarking | Builds awareness of performance in high-volume loops |
