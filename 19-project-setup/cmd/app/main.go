/*
ðŸ§  MAIN FILE WALKTHROUGH

âœ… Purpose:
- Acts as the entry point for the application.
- Connects internal logic (domain objects) with reusable utilities.

âœ… Key Concepts:
| Concept                | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `cmd/app/main.go`       | Organized entry for CLI or service |
| Import from `internal/` | Protected domain-specific logic |
| Import from `pkg/`      | Shared helper functions |
| Layer separation        | App startup doesn't need to know inner logic details |

ðŸ”” Lesson:
- Main stays thin (only wiring things together).
- Business logic lives elsewhere (clean separation of concerns).
